# MudBike
Project 1 from Dive Into SpriteKit
Exercise complete, including challenges.
However, I tried to rename the project from DiveIntoSpriteKit to MudBike, and the createObjects() function stopped... creating objects.
To the best of my knowledge nothing changed between the two project names, and the function was working well.
